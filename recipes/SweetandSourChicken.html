<p>Sweet and Sour Chicken is a classic Chinese takeout option most of us are too
    afraid to make at home. Something about woks and cooking with pineapple make
    it intimidating for most, but it is so much easier to make than you would think.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Of the classic Chinese Recipes that most people ask for on my blog the one I hear
    about the absolute most is sweet and sour chicken. I totally get it, it isn’t
    even just the recipe, but THAT SAUCE. When I was a teenager and I made this sauce
    for the first time I also actually started learning how to use chopsticks. So for
    a solid month (I kid you not, my mom was not thrilled with this), I used chopsticks
    for every meal and had a tiny little bowl of Sweet and Sour Chicken Sauce to dip
    everything into it.</p>

<h2> Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 pounds chicken breasts cut into 1” chunks</li>
    <li>1/2 cup cornstarch</li>
    <li>2 eggs beaten</li>
    <li>1/4 cup flour</li>
    <li>canola oil for frying</li>
    <li>1 cup pineapple chunks</li>
    <li>1 red bell pepper cut into 1” chunks</li>
    <li>1 green bell pepper cut into 1” chunks</li>
    <li>1/2 yellow onion cut into 1” chunks</li>
    <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
    <li>1/3 cup ketchup</li>
    <li>4 teaspoons reduced sodium soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic minced</li></ul>

<h2> Ingredients</h2>
<ol>
    <li>To make the sauce, whisk together the sugar, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, ketchup, soy sauce and garlic into a small bowl.</li>
    <li>Pour enough canola oil into a dutch oven or frying pan that is comes up from the bottom about an inch to an inch and a half.</li>
    <li>Heat the oil on medium high to high heat, you’re looking for the chicken to cook and brown in about 2-3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the cornstarch to a large ziplock bag.</li>
    <li>Add the chicken pieces to the large ziplock bag and shake until all the pieces are well coated.</li>
    <li>Dip the pieces into the egg, then into the flour before adding to the hot oil.</li>
    <li>Cook the chicken for 2-3 minutes, until cooked through and crispy.</li>
    <li>Remove to a cookie sheet (no paper towels!) and continue cooking all the chicken pieces.</li>
    <li>When done cooking remove all but a tablespoon of the oil.</li>
    <li>Add the bell peppers, onion and pineapple and cook for 1-2 minutes, until crisp-tender.</li>
    <li>Add the sauce back in and stir to coat the pieces and cook for 30 seconds to help the garlic warm through.</li>
    <li>Add the chicken pieces back in and stir until the sauce has thickened and bubbling.</li>
    <li>Serve immediately, with optional garnishes of sesame seeds or green onions.</li>
